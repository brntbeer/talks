# Sharing Your Materials Is Better For Everyone


Open source has been exploding for developers and designers in the last
few years. Materials are now out in the wild that allow someone to get
up to speed so much faster than previously possible. With the power of
Git and GitHub, sharing has never been easier, so why can't the same be true
for all teaching materials?

Companies and universities spend time and money every year training and
teaching the same things to new students. What happens if the teacher isn't
there, or a substitute is in their place? This student to teacher
relationship falls apart and learning is now even more difficult. If the
student had access to their material, they could work through it themselves.
If the substitute was able to see an example of what was prepared last year
they could expand upon it or use it outright without need for the
teacher to customize a new lesson plan.

In this session, we'll see how having your teaching material stored in Git
and on GitHub allows students to stay in touch with each other as well as
their professor regardless of physical presence to enhance everyones'
learning.
