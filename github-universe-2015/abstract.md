# Pull Requests, code review, and the GitHub Flow

Pull Requests are one of most essential workflow pieces of modern application development. If used effectively with proper code review and your existing workflow, they can not only help ensure high quality of written code, but do so without sacrificing the speed of development.

We'll start out by looking at what makes a great pull request, and what barriers people have with sending and receiving them. Next, we'll remove some of those barriers by discussing some code review best practices to ensure the code we're writing is well written and well tested. Lastly, we'll see how and why these pieces are a crucial part of a proper workflow, and what advantages the GitHub Flow has.

  - _It’s too easy for us as developers to say that a specific change won’t break something and later realise it did break the app. Often we are simply too lazy to really run all of our tests. This is where an automated system that runs or tests whenever we do any changes continuously can help us from falling into the trap._
