## Summary of presentation, for the attendee (Abstract)

Have you been told that your company is moving to a more DevOps development culture, but you have no idea what that really means? Everyone wants to run a more productive and agile engineering team by balancing the competing priorities of rapid releases and stable systems. DevOps is a movement that everyone is either wishing they had, talking about setting up, or getting ready to implement. But how does your company chat client fit into this and how can it help speed things up?

In this talk we'll look at ChatOps and how it can bring GitHub and many core DevOps tools and philosophies to developers' fingertips for everyone's benefit. We'll also see what other tools can plug into a chat client to optimize development workflows, and what immediate results we can expect to see as we start implementing integrations. By the end of this session, we will have outlined clear steps to ship code faster and safer today.

## Message for the organizers, motivation for your presentation (If needed)

DevOps is such a hot term right now, whether it's startups, well established financial companies, or telecom companies looking to attract new talent. However, what does it really mean to implement DevOps? How does your team start implementing DevOps? How can ChatOps help you bring existing tools into chat to start moving to a DevOps culture today?

This talk will take a look at the way forward for a developer to start increasing their value at their company. We'll start by looking at what types of events can be taken out of a terminal and into a shared chat environment and how sharing this knowledge with the rest of your coworkers makes everyone better. Lastly, we'll see why using ChatOps within your DevOps culture creates happier and more efficient developers.

### Notes
- From Holman's post:
```
The simplest way to achieve this visibility is through chat. A common pattern might be to set up deploy commands that simultaneously lock production like:

/deploy <app>/<branch> to <environment>

i.e.,

/deploy api/new-permissions to production
```

### Feedback
#### IP Expo Manchester
- I didn't have enough time to talk about trello in detail
  - the talk time was only 30min?!
  - shorten that bit by excluding the setup of variables
  - I spent SO much time on that making the video look good. oh well. learning experience
- Finished right on time. Great attention from those around the room!
  - Heard a few people say they thought it was interesting to themselves, someone "woo!"d at the end, and had a couple people come up to me to just tell me they thought it was great.
- The video part around scripts needs rehearsed so i can practice saying things during some repetitive sections
  - or if they're repetitive i can exclude them?
