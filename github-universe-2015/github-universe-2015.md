# Outline

## Pull Request
- What are they?
- How do you use them?
- What are ways to do them well

### Testing, all the time.
- White paper research
- "Use Travis CI, or some other testing service"
- Link to a RubyHoedown 2012 talk maybe where someone (big in ruby) was saying that even a few minutes a day of spending time testing would roll up into minutes lost, then hours, then days over the course of a project

### Summary
- Use Pull Request
- Talk to your team
- Speak like a human

  - _It’s too easy for us as developers to say that a specific change won’t break something and later realise it did break the app. Often we are simply too lazy to really run all of our tests. This is where an automated system that runs or tests whenever we do any changes continuously can help us from falling into the trap._
