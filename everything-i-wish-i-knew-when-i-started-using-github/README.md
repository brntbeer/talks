# Everything I Wish I Knew When I Started Using GitHub

This talk was a part of the sponsored track session at OSCON 2015 in Portland, OR, USA. Presented by Brent Beer.

## Description
Everyone can find something useful on GitHub, whether it’s to learn about some new framework, contribute to open source, or collaborate on an internal project. If you haven’t used it for a while, you may not be leveraging everything it has to offer. What you need is a good explanation of these features you wish you had on your first day.

We’ll start out looking at some features that will help enhance your view of the entire ecosystem; and we’ll dive into strategies for extending GitHub to make your projects work better not only for you, but for your entire team. You will walk away from this talk with all the information you need to use every inch of GitHub on your own and with your colleagues.
